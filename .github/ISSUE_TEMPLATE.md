If you are submitting a suggestion, be specific both about what is "missing" and what you propose to fill the gap.

If you are submitting a bug, please let me know:
 - What went wrong (specifics).
 - What version of Firefox you are using.
 - If you can, explain the procedure that caused the problem, so that I can reproduce it and investigate.
