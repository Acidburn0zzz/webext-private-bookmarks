Private Bookmarks enables a special password-protected bookmark folder. Your private bookmarks are encrypted with your chosen password. This is not an online service, and no data leaves your machine.

When you unlock your private bookmarks, a new 'Private Bookmarks' folder appears under 'Other Bookmarks'. You can add/remove items to it and when ready, lock it. When locked, the folder's contents are encrypted with your password and stored on your machine, while the folder itself is removed from your browser's bookmarks collection.

By default, Private Bookmarks can only be accessed when in private browsing (to help avoid accidents), however that can be changed via the options page.

<b>Keyboard shortcuts</b>
Both of these shortcuts are available while private bookmarks are unlocked:
 * Ctrl+Shift+8 adds the current page to your private bookmarks.
 * Ctrl+Shift+L locks the folder.

This extension is still in early development, so bugs are to be expected.
