Private Bookmarks enables a special password-protected bookmark folder. Your private bookmarks are encrypted with your chosen password. This is not an online service, and no data leaves your machine.

When you unlock your private bookmarks, a new 'Private Bookmarks' folder appears under 'Other Bookmarks'. You can add/remove items to it and when ready, lock it. When locked, the folder's contents are encrypted with your password and stored on your machine, while the folder itself is removed from your browser's bookmarks collection.

By default, Private Bookmarks can only be accessed when in private browsing (to help avoid accidents), however that can be changed via the options page.

<b>Be aware!</b>
This extension is still in early development, so bugs are to be expected, and you should backup your bookmarks if they are important.

<b>Auto-locking</b>
There are a few cases where the extension auto locks your private bookmarks:
<ul>
<li>If you have selected the "disable outside of private browsing" option (it is on by default) private bookmarks auto-locks when the last private window is closed.</li>
<li>If you manually delete the Private Bookmarks folder. In this case there will be no syncing of changes to your encrypted storage.</li>
<li>If you close the browser while your private bookmarks are unlocked, the next time you open it the leftover Private Bookmarks folder is deleted immediately. In this case there will be no syncing of changes to your encrypted storage.</li>
</ul>

<b>Keyboard shortcuts</b>
Both of these shortcuts are available while private bookmarks are unlocked:
<ul>
<li>Ctrl+Shift+8 adds the current page to your private bookmarks.</li>
<li>Ctrl+Shift+L locks the folder.</li>
</ul>
