                <b>Private Bookmarks remembers where you move it to:</b> If you move your unlocked
                private bookmarks folder somewhere, the next time you unlock it will appear there
                instead of under 'Other Bookmarks'.

                <b>Not a fan of our password requirements? You can disable them:</b>
                The default requirement for passwords to be at least 8 characters long and contain
                at least one letter and one number helps making your passwords stronger. But, if you
                don't care about that you can now disable these requirements from the options page.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Import backup from several files at once:</b> You can now select multiple files to
                import from (provided they share the same password).
