        These are the release notes for Private Bookmarks 0.1.13, released on 13/12/2017.
    </p>
    <p>
        After several weeks of work, a new release is here - just in time for the holidays! The
        biggest addition is the ability to opt-in for syncing of your preferences and bookmarks
        across devices. In addition, this release contains a few quality-of-life changes and a lot
        of work behind the scenes to help improve stability and make it easier to add new features in
        the future. I tried to test all of these as best I could, but I am one person and I'm sure
        there are bugs I've missed - so back up your bookmarks! If you do find a bug,
        <a href="https://github.com/rharel/webext-private-bookmarks/issues"
           target="_blank">let me know</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's it for now. Wishing you a happy holiday season, <br>

                <b>Sync bookmarks and preferences across devices:</b>
                You can opt-in for syncing of your data
                across devices (check the options page). Please note that Firefox Sync is not
                exactly as instantaneous as some other tools (e.g. Google Drive), but it at least
                gets your data over to your other desktop (eventually). The browser also imposes
                a limit on how much data an extension is allowed to sync, but it should be enough
                for a couple hundred bookmarks.

                <b>Open the main menu in a new tab with a keyboard shortcut:</b>
                Use <span class="code">Alt+Shift+8</span> to open the menu in a new tab. If you
                have the 'disable outside of private browsing' option enabled, the tab will open
                in a private window.
